## EOSC Deployment Service

The EOSC Deployment Service, implemented through the [Infrastructure Manager](https://im.egi.eu?target=_blank) (IM),Â is an open-source service to deploy complex applications on multiple Cloud back-ends ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com?target=_blank), [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org?target=_blank), etc.). It performs virtualized infrastructure provision, automatic software deployment, and lifecycle management of these applications. It supports the [OASIS TOSCA](https://www.oasis-open.org?target=_blank) (Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications) standard for application architecture description.
