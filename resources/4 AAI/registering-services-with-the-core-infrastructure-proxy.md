# Service Registration in the EOSC Core Innovation Sandbox via the Core Infrastructure Proxy


## Description

This page explains how to register a service with the Core Infrastructure Proxy. Services can be registered through the Core Service Registry portal using either the OpenID Connect (OIDC) or SAML protocol. Providers of services can use the portal to view and also manage their services by creating and submitting service requests. Both service registration and reconfiguration requests need to be reviewed by the EOSC Core Innovation Sandbox AAI Support Team.

## AAI Endpoints

### OpenID Connect

**Environment** | **Core Infrastructure Proxy OIDC/OAuth2 Issuer**
--- | ---
**Pre-production** | `https://core-proxy.sandbox.eosc-beyond.eu/auth/realms/core`
**Staging** | _TBD_

The Core Infrastructure Proxy supports OpenID Connect Discovery. OpenID Connect client libraries that support OpenID Connect Discovery will be able to find and configure the appropriate endpoints from the Core Infrastructure Proxy discovery endpoint.

If the OpenID Connect client library your service is using does not support OpenID Connect Discovery, then you can find all the required endpoints at the following URL:

`<issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration`

### SAML 2.0

**Environment** | **Core Infrastructure Proxy SAML 2.0 Identity Provider Entity ID** | **SAML 2.0 Identity Provider Metadata URL**
--- | --- | ---
**Pre-poduction** | `https://core-proxy.sandbox.eosc-beyond.eu/auth/realms/core` | [https://core-proxy.sandbox.eosc-beyond.eu/auth/realms/core/protocol/saml/descriptor](https://core-proxy.sandbox.eosc-beyond.eu/auth/realms/core/protocol/saml/descriptor)
**Staging** | _TBD_ | _TBD_

### Registration Request Submission

After clicking **"Submit"**, you'll receive a confirmation email for your registration request. Users with reviewing privileges will be notified to assess the request. Approved requests are deployed to the requested integration environment. The Support team reviews requests based on the Integration Environment, and you'll be notified via email upon completion. Reviewers can propose changes to the pending request. The proposed changes will be included in the email notification.

## Managing Service Owners

Services are owned by user groups with regular members and group managers. All members can view and submit reconfiguration requests to the service. Group managers have additional privileges, such as inviting/removing members to/from the owners group. When a user requests to register a service, an owners group is automatically created with the requester set as the group manager. To view/manage the owners group, select **"Manage Owners"**.
