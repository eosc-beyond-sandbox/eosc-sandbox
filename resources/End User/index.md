# END-USERS
The EOSC Innovation Sandbox offers end-users a secure and controlled environment to explore, test, and interact with EOSC services and resources before they are deployed in a live setting. This space is particularly valuable for researchers and developers looking to validate new tools, experiment with data integrations, and simulate various research scenarios without impacting production systems. By providing early access to innovative features and experimental services, the sandbox empowers users to familiarize themselves with the EOSC ecosystem, optimize workflows, and provide valuable feedback that shapes the future development of EOSC services.

## Infrastructure Access
End-users can access the EOSC INNOVATION SANDBOX infrastructure through a user-friendly interface designed to streamline the discovery, selection, and usage of research resources. Users can explore services, research products, and data sources through the EOSC Marketplace and Resource Discovery Hub. Access is granted through a federated Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure (AAI) system, ensuring secure and seamless connectivity.

## Getting Started
To get started, users must register on the EOSC platform using federated credentials. Upon registration, users gain access to a range of research services, data repositories, training resources, and collaborative tools. The EOSC Innovation Sandbox offers comprehensive guides, tutorials, and documentation to support users in navigating the available services and resources effectively.

## Compliance and Policy
All end-users must adhere to EOSCâ€™s compliance and policy frameworks, which are designed to uphold data privacy, security, and ethical research standards.
