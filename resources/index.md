# EOSC Documentation Hub

## Welcome to the EOSC Documentation Hub

A single place for:

- [Pilot Nodes](resources/Pilot%20Node/index.md) to learn why and how to become an EOSC Pilot Node.
- [Service Providers](resources/Service%20Provider/index.md) to learn why and how to become an EOSC Provider. To register and manage your resources so they are available in the EOSC Catalogue and Marketplace. And access related documentation, training and support.
