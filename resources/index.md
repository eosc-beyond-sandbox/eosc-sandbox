The EOSC Core Innovation Sandbox by [EOSC Beyond](https://www.eosc-beyond.eu/) is a pre-production environment of the EOSC Platform that acts as a testing and staging environment - equipped with advanced automation tools - for EOSC Core service providers, EOSC Exchange service providers and EOSC Nodes in the integration process with EOSC. Here we have gathered more technical information about specific services within the sandbox, while an overview of these services is available on the official [EOSC Core Innovation Sandbox page](https://sandbox.eosc-beyond.eu/).
