# EOSC Architecture

The **European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)** is a **federated system** designed to enable seamless sharing, discovery, and access to research resources across Europe. It consists of interconnected **EOSC Nodes**, which can be national, regional, or thematic infrastructures that provide services, datasets, and computational resources to the research community.

At the core of the EOSC architecture are the **EOSC Federating Capabilities**, a set of key functionalities that allow Nodes to collaborate and offer integrated services. These currently include:

- **Identity and Access Management (AAI)** for secure authentication and authorization,
- **Federated Resource Catalogues** to facilitate discovery and access to research products,
- **Application Workflow Management** for deploying and running scientific applications across multiple nodes,
- **Monitoring and Accounting** for tracking resource usage and service performance,
- **Order Management and Helpdesk** to streamline service provisioning and user support.

A key component of this architecture is the **EOSC Core Innovation Sandbox**, an experimental environment of the **EOSC EU Node**. This sandbox provides a **testing ground** forÂ  EOSC Pilot Nodes, service providers, developers and end-users to integrate, validate, and refine their services before full production deployment. By using the **sandbox environment**, prospective EOSC Nodes can ensure compliance with **EOSC interoperability standards** and progressively adopt core services.

The **EOSC EU Node** serves as the first fully operational reference implementation, setting a model for interoperability, governance, and federated service delivery. Each EOSC Node must align with the **EOSC Interoperability Framework (EOSC-IF)** to ensure seamless integration, resource sharing, and compliance with common technical standards.

The **EOSC Federation** operates as a **network of peer-to-peer Nodes**, where each contributes to a shared ecosystem, fostering collaboration across disciplines and providing researchers with high-quality, interoperable digital services and datasets.

**Pilot Nodes** are federated infrastructures (national, regional, or thematic) that aim to become **EOSC Nodes** by progressively adopting EOSC Core Services like AAI, catalogues, helpdesk, and monitoring. They follow a **maturity model**, integrating federating capabilities and testing their interoperability in the **EOSC Core Innovation Sandbox** before full deployment.

**Service Providers**, on the other hand, offer **specific services, datasets, or research products** without managing a full infrastructure. They onboard their resources to the **EOSC Marketplace or Resource Catalogue**, making them accessible to the research community without necessarily integrating federated capabilities.

While **Pilot Nodes evolve into EOSC Nodes**, **Service Providers contribute standalone resources**, both enriching the EOSC ecosystem.
