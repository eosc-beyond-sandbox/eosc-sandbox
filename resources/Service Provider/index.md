# Onboarding

## Instructions to onboard Service Providers and Services to EOSC

Do you want to onboard your services to the EOSC Core Innovation Sandbox? In this section, the main steps for onboarding are described in more detail.

### Who can Onboard Service Providers and Resources?

A Service Provider in EOSC is an organisation that offers research-related resources such as services, datasets, software, publications, or other research products, with the goal of supporting scientific excellence and productivity through interoperable, high-quality services.
To onboard as a Service Provider or to onboard a resource, you must meet the following requirements:

### Legal Accountability
 You must be a legal entity or be affiliated with one (called the hosting legal entity) that will take full legal responsibility for the services or resources being onboarded. If your organisation is not a legal entity, the hosting legal entity must first be onboarded as an EOSC Provider.


### Federated or Joint Resources
 If the resource is provided by multiple organisations, the lead or coordinating provider is responsible for onboarding. Other contributors must also be onboarded as EOSC Providers and listed as supporting providers in the resource profile.


### Targeting EOSC Services or Communities
 Resources must be intended for EOSC users or communities, or built on EOSC-Core capabilities. You may also onboard services targeting other communities, as long as they leverage EOSC infrastructure.


### Effective Service Delivery
 You must ensure reliable and effective delivery of your services or resources, including those offered by your collaborators.


### Accurate and Up-to-date Information in English
 All provider and resource information must be submitted in English using the designated forms. This includes keeping contact details, links, and service status regularly updated, and removing any resources that are no longer available.


### Support in English
 Services must offer at least basic support in English, including user interfaces, documentation, instructions, and helpdesk support.

## The EOSC Onboarding Process
The EOSC onboarding process ensures that only high-quality and interoperable resources are included in the EOSC Catalogue, making them useful for researchers.
As a Service Provider, you can onboard your own resources (such as services, data sources, research products, or training materials) directly to the EOSC Catalogue.
You are responsible for registering and describing each resource you offer.
To complete the onboarding, you must provide detailed information about: Your organisation (the Provider), Each resource you want to include
This information must follow the EOSC Profiles, which are metadata standards used to describe Providers and different resource types.

## How to Submit Information to Register Service Providers and Resources
Once the necessary information has been collected, EOSC Providers can use two methods to submit information for inclusion in the EOSC Catalogue and Marketplace:
- Use the EOSC Service Providers Dashboard
- Use API interfaces for EOSC

Where appropriate in the instructions below, the possibilities for using either the Service Providers Dashboard or the APIs are described in more detail. 
Note that the API allows information about multiple records (e.g. EOSC Resources) to be submitted or updated at a time, while the Service Providers Dashboard requires records to be submitted or updated one at a time.  To use the API, the Provider’s Representative needs to use the AAI of the Service Providers Dashboard to retrieve a new API token. (Consult https://providers.eosc-portal.eu/developers for more on the API Interfaces.)
