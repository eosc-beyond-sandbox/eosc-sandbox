## EOSC Beyond Accounting for Services

The EOSC Accounting for Services is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline the collection, aggregation, and exchange of metrics across various infrastructures, providers, and projects. The service comprises two main components:

- Accounting User Interface - the primary interaction point for clients accessing the Accounting Service. It offers a graphical interface that enables users to view and interact with accounting data.
- Accounting API - a REST API that accepts input data from external systems and stores it in a database. The API aggregates and processes the data, making it accessible for querying through the user interface.
