## EOSC Beyond User Dashboard

EOSC User Dashboard is an AI-based - personalized to some extent - user environment to display users' personal website space. Each user can define and design his scientific profile and - based on it - receive resources tailored to their needs. The dashboard helps them find resources that match their specific fields of interest, making it more straightforward to explore the EOSC Resource Discovery Hub. It consists of an informative landing page and a personal subpage available only for authenticated users.
