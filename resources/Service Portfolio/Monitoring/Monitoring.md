As part of the EOSC Beyond Sandbox, both providers and users will have the opportunity to test its functionality in real-world conditions. This testing phase is crucial for refining the service before full-scale deployment. It aims to gather feedback from early adopters and ensure that the service effectively addresses the diverse monitoring needs of EOSC stakeholders across various domains.
