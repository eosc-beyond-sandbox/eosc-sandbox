## EOSC PID Service

The Persistent Identifiers (PID) Service offers a robust, reliable solution for the long-term identification and management of digital objects underpinned by leading European data centers and cutting-edge technology. Here are the core value propositions of the PID Service:

1. **Global Persistence and Reliability**: the PID Service ensures enduring identification of digital objects through a globally resolvable Handle System. This persistence is crucial for maintaining long-term access and usability of research data, tools, and resources.
2. **High Performance and Redundancy**: Utilizing advanced data center infrastructure and a redundancy scheme compliant with ePIC Consortiumâ€™s Quality of Service policies, the PID Service guarantees high performance and reliability. The primary-mirror federation architecture ensures that PIDs are mirrored across multiple providers, minimizing the risk of service disruption.
3. **Advanced Technology Integration**: The service is based on B2HANDLE technology, incorporating the distributed Handle System solution for efficient storage, management, and resolution of PIDs. It supports both REST API and native Handle API, enabling seamless integration with middleware applications, end-user tools, and other services.
4. **Flexible and Accessible Interfaces**: The PID Service provides both a REST API and a native Handle API, catering to diverse user needs. These interfaces facilitate easy integration and interaction with the PID service, whether for managing data objects or integrating with other digital infrastructures.
5. **Secure and Scalable Infrastructure**: Leveraging the latest advancements in virtualization and data storage technologies, the PID Service ensures secure, scalable, and efficient handling of PIDs. This infrastructure supports a wide range of applications, from catalogues and registries to training materials and guidelines.
6. **Global Resolve Capability**: PIDs are globally resolvable through the DONA Global Handle Registry network, ensuring that identifiers remain consistent and accessible across different systems and locations, regardless of changes in object location or ownership.
7. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The PID Service supports a broad spectrum of catalogues and registries, including services/providers, tools, training materials, and guidelines, enhancing the traceability and management of various digital resources.

By delivering a high-performance, reliable, and globally accessible PID service, the PID Service ensures that digital objects are effectively managed and identified over time, supporting the integrity and continuity of research and data management efforts.
