# Messaging

## EOSC Messaging Service

EOSC Messaging Service is based on the ARGO Messaging Service (AMS), an asynchronous messaging service based on open specifications and designed to be highly reliable and scalable. EOSC Messaging plays a key role in the EOSC ecosystem by filling the gap in the end-to-end interconnection between services, supporting technical interoperability, enforcing the adoption of common standards, and becoming the main transport layer. The caching mechanism that EOSC Messaging supports in accordance with the pull/push functionality with extended features can easily be a solution for services that need to exchange information. With the use of AMS-library (a Python library) and AMS-UI, the service supports easy access to the data without needing specific knowledge about how to query them and how to interact with the service.
