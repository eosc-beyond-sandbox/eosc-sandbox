#  Pilot Node

## Benefits of Becoming an EOSC Pilot Node

Becoming an EOSC Pilot Node offers several benefits for national, regional, European, or thematic research collaborations/infrastructures. These advantages align with promoting open science, enhancing interoperability, and increasing visibility within the broader European research community.

## How to Become an EOSC Pilot Node and share/use resources in EOSC 

To become an EOSC Pilot Node and share or use resources within EOSC, you’ll need to follow a set of steps that align with EOSC’s framework and requirements, an EOSC Node must comply with the EOSC Federation policies, as well as with its legal and technical frameworks. Here's a general **guide** to help you through the process

## The EOSC Pilot Node Enrollment Process

Do you want to enroll your Node in the EOSC Core Innovation Sandbox? In this section, the main steps for enrolling are described in more detail. We offer the possibility of using the EOSC Innovation Sandbox as a test node, allowing prospective EOSC Nodes to integrate and validate their infrastructure before moving into production. This enables organizations to experiment with core EOSC services such as AAI, Helpdesk, and Catalogues while ensuring interoperability with the EOSC Federation. Our team of technical experts is available to provide guidance and support throughout the process. For assistance, contact <support@sandbox.eosc-beyond.eu> with a brief description of your use case and integration goals.

### Instructions to enroll Pilot Nodes to EOSC Core Innovation Sandbox

If you are representing a potential new EOSC Node or a service provider, you can use the EOSC Innovation Sandbox to integrate your Node with EOSC and test and validate your work before moving into production. A team of technical experts is available to support you in this process. Please contact <support@sandbox.eosc-beyond.eu> shortly describing your case and the type of integration you would like to achieve (e.g., setting up a new EOSC node for the structural biology community, etc.).

### Information Required about Nodes and their Resources

We have defined a **maturity scale for Pilot Nodes**, which varies depending on the core services they are able to adopt or develop within the federation. At a **lower maturity level**, a Pilot Node should at least integrate **AAI (Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure) and a Catalogue service**, which are fundamental to ensuring interoperability and resource discoverability within EOSC.

As the node progresses in its maturity, it should evaluate and integrate additional federating capabilities, such as **Helpdesk, Monitoring, Accounting, and Messaging services**, aligning its infrastructure with the EOSC Federation model. The goal is to reach the necessary level of readiness to be recognized as an **EOSC Candidate Node**, capable of effectively contributing to the federation's ecosystem.

The ultimate objective for a Pilot Node is to develop a **fully operational Infrastructure Manager System**, which is essential to becoming a fully recognized EOSC Node. Further details on this process and specific requirements can be found in the **EOSC Handbook**.
